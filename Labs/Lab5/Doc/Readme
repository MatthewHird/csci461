Tosf Version 0.4-5 March 2020
--------------------------------
Tosf is a framework for developing real-time systems using finite state
machines. Tosf supports earliest deadline first scheduling (EDF).

Directory Structure
===================
System:
   Tosf: all the tosf system files
   Mgen: a tool to autogenerate verification makefiles

Example 1: the traffic light example from Lab9 csci355 
   tlightApp: 
   CentralizedTL: control and lights GUI together

Example 2: simple traces
    traceApp: Instrumented traces for system behaviour verification
    (includes wiki trace example
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earliest_deadline_first_scheduling)

Example 3: 
    goldApp: Distributed Goldberg Machine

Example 4: 
    miscApp: miscellaneous applications
    
Notes on Makefile Customization 
================================
A master makefile manages the sub-directories and files inside TosfDev.
In turn, each subdirectory of TosfDev has its own  makefile. Modules to
be cleaned and tested must be enumerated in these makefile.

Modules with .mmt extensions are stored in Fsm directories.  Each of there
directories must have a makefile to translate .mmt files to .pm files.
These makefiles do not need to be customized.

Each "Verification"  directory needs a makefile that is automatically
generated by executing gen.pl in Mgen. The modules that need
a verification makefile must be enumerated in gen.pl. 

Directory Structure
===================

Tosf is implements in OO Perl. Classes are implemented using modules
and related modules are stored in a directory. The directory structure
is exemplified using Demo as follows:

Demo                           # Class Directory
   Lifo.pm                     # Class Module Implementation for Lifo
   Verification                # Verification Directory
      Lifo                     # Verification Directory for Lifo
         Lifo.mis              # Module Interface Specification for Lifo
         test_plan             # Test Plan for Lifo
         lifo_tst.pl           # Interactive Tester for Lifo
         tb.cew                # Test Bench for Lifo
         Makefile
